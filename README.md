Interview Task
Your task is to write a small search function to find users in Github in ReactJS.

The app should be a one-page application.

The app should be able to free text search with a textbox and search button. The user should also be able to press the "enter" button to search.

The app should be able to show the first ten users with a username, gravatar, and a link to the profile.

The API used is the GitHub API https://api.github.com/. The part of the API you will be using is /search/users?q={search}. It will return everything you need to list the profiles in a JSON format.

If you have any questions please let me know. I would recommend using "npx create-react-app" or something like that to get started
